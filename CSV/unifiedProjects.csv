Defending the European Energy Infrastructures,"Critical Energy infrastructures (CEI) protection and security are becoming of utmost importance in our everyday life. However, cyber and system-theoretic approaches fail to provide appropriate security levels to CEIs, since they are often used in isolation and build on incomplete attack models, resulting in silos-like security management fragmented operational policies. To face these challenges, DEFENDER will (i) model CEIs as distributed Cyber-Physical Systems for managing the potential reciprocal effects of cyber and physical threats (ii) deploy a novel security governance model, which leverages on lifecycle assessment for cost-effective security management over the time (iii) bring people at centre stage by empowering them as virtual sensors for threat detection, as first level emergency responders to attacks, or by considering workforce as potential threats. DEFENDER will adapt, integrate, upscale and validate a number of TRL 4-5 technologies and deploy them within a TRL7 integrated yet adaptable framework for CEI security, resilience and self-healing “by design”, with a view to address, detect, and mitigate cyber-physical threats. To this aim DEFENDER framework will combine a range of devices/technologies for situational awareness (fixed sensors like PMUs, mobile devices like drones and advanced video surveillance) (ii) intelligent processing for cyber-physical threat detection with (iii) a toolbox for incident mitigation and emergency response and (iv) Human-In-The-Loop for managing people interaction with CEI, while leveraging on blockchain technology for peer-to-peer trustworthiness. The effectiveness of DEFENDER will be extensively validated on a CEI lab emulator (RWTH, Germany) and on 4 real life demonstrators (in Belgium, Italy and Slovenia) fully covering the overall energy value chain, ranging from a nuclear generation plant (ENGIE), to a decentralized RES generation one(BFP), a TSO HV network (ELES), to a DSO network (ASM) and a business prosumer.",ENGINEERING - INGEGNERIA INFORMATICA SPA,"['E-LEX - STUDIO LEGALE', 'SIEMENS SRL', 'INSTITUT JOZEF STEFAN', 'ELES DOO SISTEMSKI OPERATOR PRENOSNEGA ELEKTROENERGETSKEGA OMREZJA', 'VENAKA MEDIA LIMITED', 'INSTITUT ZA KORPORATIVNE VARNOSTNE STUDIJE LJUBLJANA', 'ASM TERNI SPA', 'RHEINISCH-WESTFAELISCHE TECHNISCHE HOCHSCHULE AACHEN', ""MINISTERO DELL'INTERNO"", 'UNINOVA-INSTITUTO DE DESENVOLVIMENTO DE NOVAS TECNOLOGIAS-ASSOCIACAO', 'SINGULARLOGIC ANONYMI ETAIRIA PLIROFORIAKON SISTIMATON KAI EFARMOGON PLIROFORIKIS', 'DR FRUCHT SYSTEMS LTD', 'INEO ENERGY AND SYSTEMS', 'THALES SA', 'POWER OPERATIONS LIMITED', 'TECHNOLOGIKO EKPEDEFTIKO IDRIMA STEREAS ELLADAS', 'STUDIO TECNICO BFP SOCIETA A RESPONSABILITA LIMITATA']","8859937,5",Blockchain,CORDIS

Blockchains in the new era of participatory media experience,"Digital technologies have transformed media content production and distribution in the global entertainment and media industry over the last two decades. The market is forecast to continue to grow over the next five years, and is currently estimated to be worth just over $2 trillion . Acute challenges remain, though, especially relating to the way in which digital content can be copied and freely distributed on the Internet, and how content contributors are compensated when their materials are used or bought through legitimate channels. The blockchain technology and the virtual currencies can provide the ideal, cost effective framework for payments, preserving privacy, low commission fees, instant financial transactions, without intermediaries. 
The main goal of the Bloomen proposal is to extend the use of the blockchain technology to handle different online user transactions, provide an innovative way of content creation, sharing, personalized consumption, monetization and copyrighting.  
In particular within the Bloomen project,  blockchains will be used as a distributed database for media copyright information, for fast micropayments of media content, and for transparency in copyright management and monetization. 
The project will deliver among others innovative services for the media industry and its results will be validated in three pilot use cases: i) User generated content and news, sharing, copyrighting and monetizing through social media and blockchains, ii) Music industry digital content broadcasting in open, blockchain enabled markets, iii) Media content delivery through WebTV and cyrptocurrency paywalls.

Interacting Decentralized Transactional and Ledger Architecture for Mutual Credit,"The objective of INTERLACE is to use the Abstract State Interaction Machines framework (CoreASIM) open source output of the FP7 FET project BIOMICS to develop a decentralized transactional and ledger architecture demonstrator for B2B mutual credit. INTERLACE will add to the work already started by its coordinator, Sardex s.r.l., to develop this architecture. SARDEX will use the Open Transaction protocol (OTX) as an intermediate solution between fully centralized and distributed architectures. OTX involves a pool of Auditor nodes to validate the transactions executed by each Notary node. In INTERLACE there will be only one central Notary, as a first step from the current centralized server towards a more distributed architecture. The persistence layer will be implemented as a private blockchain stored on the central server to create a sparse 160-bit address space implemented as a binary hash tree. This approach achieves continuity with the existing solution while also enabling scalability to multiple circuits (multiple Notaries) under the same mathematical and computational framework. SARDEX has been operating successfully an electronic, B2B, zero-interest mutual credit system on the island of Sardinia since 2009. The Sardex system (also known as Circuito di Credito Commerciale) enables local economic actors (SMEs in particular) to trade with each other in a trustful and circular fashion with a unique digital trade credit unit. It does this by monetizing the spare capacity of the local economy in the form of mutual, and taxable, credit between participating companies, at zero interest, on a strong basis of trust, solidarity, and local cultural identity. Therefore, INTERLACE will address very effectively the Workprogramme objective to generate socio-economic impact from EU-funded research. INTERLACE is uniquely positioned to integrate the very advanced results of BIOMICS directly in a deeply innovative, transformative, and successful fintech platform for B2B trade.",SARDEX SRL,"['Fachhochschule Salzburg GmbH', 'Universität Passau', 'THE UNIVERSITY OF HERTFORDSHIRE HIGHER EDUCATION CORPORATION']","99978,75",Blockchain,CORDIS
Decentralised Citizens Owned Data Ecosystem,"Today’s Internet is becoming increasingly centralised, slowing innovation and challenging its potential to revolutionise society and the economy in a pluralistic manner. DECODE will develop practical alternatives through the creation, evaluation and demonstration of a distributed and open architecture for managing online identity, personal and other data, and collective governance in a citizen-friendly and privacy-aware fashion. Strong digital rights that makes it possible for data subjects to determine access rights to their information through flexible entitlements and open standard-based agreements regarding data governance (on the model of Creative Commons licenses) will be woven into the technological architecture.

DECODE will increase digital sovereignty of European citizens by enabling them to produce, access and control their data and exchange contextualised information in real-time, and in a confidential, and scalable manner. DECODE will develop a modular privacy-aware IoT hub with a free and open source operating system backed by a state of the art blockchain infrastructure supporting smart-contracts and privacy protections.

The architecture will be demonstrated through four pilots in Barcelona and Amsterdam, in the field of digital democracy, citizen sensing, and collaborative economy. The pilots will be run with the active involvement of social entrepreneurs, hackers, and makers. Innovators will be able to build solutions on top of the platform through hackathons and open challenges, while ensuring their security, resilience and privacy preserving qualities. This aims to create a decentralised innovation ecosystem that will attract a critical mass able to shift the current centralised data-driven economy towards a decentralised, sustainable and commons-based economy.

My Health - My Data,"Issues of data subjects’ privacy and data security represent a crucial challenge in the biomedical sector more than in other industries. The current IT landscape in this field shows a myriad of isolated, locally hosted patient data repositories, managed by clinical centres and other organisations, which are subject to frequent and massive data breaches. Patients are disenfranchised in this process, and are not able to have a clear understanding of who uses their personal information and for what purposes. This makes it the ideal field to build and test new models of privacy and data protection, and the technologies that encode them. MyHealthMyData (MHMD) aims at changing the existing scenario by introducing a distributed, peer-to-peer architecture, based on Blockchain and Personal Data Accounts. This approach will determine new mechanisms of trust and of direct, value-based relationships between people, hospitals, research centres and businesses, in what will be the first open biomedical information network centred on the connection between organisations and the individual. The system will develop a comprehensive methodology to guide the implementation of data and identity protection systems, specifically defining approaches and tools to profile and classify sensitive data based on their informational and economic value, to assess the most suitable and robust de-identification and encryption technologies needed to secure different types of information, to allow advanced analytics, and to evaluate the overall reliability of a generic multi modular architecture. MHMD will also analyse users’ behavioural patterns alongside ethical and cultural orientations, to identify hidden dynamics in the interactions between humans and complex information services, to improve the design of data-driven platforms and to foster the development of a true information marketplace, in which individuals will be able to exercise full control on their personal data and leverage their value.",LYNKEUS,"['MAAT FRANCE SARL', 'H W COMMUNICATIONS LIMITED', 'ATHINA-EREVNITIKO KENTRO KAINOTOMIAS STIS TECHNOLOGIES TIS PLIROFOFORIAS, TON EPIKOLNONION KAI TIS GNOSIS', 'DIGI.ME LIMITED', 'CONSIGLIO NAZIONALE DELLE RICERCHE', 'UNIVERSITATEA TRANSILVANIA DIN BRASOV', 'HAUTE ECOLE SPECIALISEE DE SUISSE OCCIDENTALE', 'DEUTSCHES HERZZENTRUM BERLIN', 'NEGRI-CLEMENTI, TOFFOLETTO, MONTIRONI & SOCI', 'UNIVERSITY COLLEGE LONDON', 'QUEEN MARY UNIVERSITY OF LONDON', 'OSPEDALE PEDIATRICO BAMBINO GESU', 'SIEMENS HEALTHCARE GMBH', 'SBA RESEARCH GEMEINNUTZIGE GMBH']",3944940,Blockchain,CORDIS

Community Energy Dynamic Solution with Blockchain (CEDISON),"Within the UK grid infrastructure environment, renewable potential is curtailed, preventing large penetration of Renewable Energy Sources and injection of all available power into the grid. This leads to an opportunity for micro-grids at the community level to be optimised, enabling local balancing and providing extra revenue schemes, i.e. electric transportation charging, or electric heating. In addition, Distributed Ledger Technologies (DLTs) such as blockchain can be used to stipulate and store smart contracts that enforce proportional fairness among participants in low-carbon microgrids. CEDISON will examine the synergy between DLTs, intelligent building monitoring and control at community level, including forecasting based on weather and electricity price and Peer-to-Peer trading to smart energy systems. CEDISON is the first of its kind to define a way to capture the benefits of local balancing markets, at building and district level, enhancing consumer digitalisation, and being able to measure the impact in rural and city district microgrids.

"Anticipating Blockchain: Identity, Power and DLT","'Blockchain' or 'distributed ledger technology' (DLT) is best known for the decentralised virtual currency, Bitcoin. But DLT is now being adopted experimentally in ever more contexts: governmental and activist as well as commercial. I propose to investigate selected emergent non-commercial or quasi-commercial DLT projects and the associated discourses and practices, combining qualitative and quantitative methods.
'Anticipating Blockchain' refers to the widespread assumption that DLT will soon have major social, economic and political impacts. Many claim it has disruptive potential to subvert power hierarchies via decentralised, peer-to-peer structures (Tapscott 2016;Economist 2016). Sceptics argue that it offers no solution to perennial problems of governance and accountability (Lehdonvirta 2016).
Bitcoin itself is indelibly associated with the darknet and crime, but also increasingly mainstream, accepted by major traders and regulators. Actors embracing other DLT applications now include advocacy, activist and creative/cultural organisations and networks, as well as states and the United Nations. The emergent UN project ID2020 proposes to assign a 'self-sovereign' biometric digital identity to every human child by 2030, using DLT to control the data. Here anticipation mixes with both futurist hope and dread. Other emergent projects, in fields such as benefits payments, medical records, performance rights, and farm-to-fork food chains, seek the benefits of transparency, efficiency and freedom from centralised power, but if they succeed, their actual impacts may well be unanticipated.
This project will assess the potential of DLT to widen digital participation, strengthen democracy, development and human rights. Critical social science has a vital role to play in unearthing the ideological assumptions surrounding blockchain as it unfolds, anticipating its value for marginalized groups, and its uses as a weapon of surveillance and control against the powerless in the name of transparency and big data.
Exploring these contradictory tendencies between empowerment and control, this research will deploy ethnographic modes of inquiry, integrating quantitative and qualitative methods, to achieve a dynamic analysis of the epistemological, ontological and human contexts in which blockchains go to work. I aim to devise a generalizable framework for assessing the value of such projects for marginalised and non-commercial groups, drawing on my previous work with refugees and on OU/CReSC Cultural Value projects.
My interest in DLT was sparked by an invitation (based on my research on digital connectivity with young Syrian refugees) to contribute to a panel discussion at the ID2020 Summit at the UN (New York, May 2016). ID2020 proposes to use DLT to provide a universal legal identity including birth registration (UN Sustainable Development Goal 16.9). My previous research had alerted to me to the way the benefits of digital connectivity for vulnerable groups are matched by risks of surveillance and Margie Cheesman, January 2017 2 repression. DLT may well be no different. Research is needed to judiciously assess its potential impacts using innovative, mixed, culturally sensitive methods.
ID2020 gave birth to other DLT projects of great interest for my work. RCUK-funded New Economic Models in the Digital Economy (NEMODE) propose a project, Digital Identity for the Identityless (Di4i), to develop 'in the wild' DLT identity solutions for homeless people, ex-offenders, migrants and refugees, in UK, Greece and Kenya, and a study on GovCoin, the Department of Work and Pension's partner trialling DLT for benefit payments. Rebooting the Web of Trust, a design workshop, is developing privacy tools for blockchain users. Like ID2020, this is a commercially sponsored non-profit, with proclaimed pro-social aims. These projects, as well as independently emerging DLT initiatives, are key research sites.",['University of Oxford'],[],0,Blockchain,EPSRC
BlockchaIn device Metric ENhanced Security (IMmENSe),"The proposal will develop novel authentication and authorisation mechanisms for networked financial data using distributed ledger (blockchain) technology. Recent progress in blockchains suggests that one of the interesting potential applications of the technology is in “disintermediation protocols”, which remove the need of having trusted third parties in a collaborative environment involving many (potentially anonymous) stakeholders. A recent UK Government report also suggests &quot;the technology offers the potential, according to the circumstances, for individual consumers to control access to personal records and to know who has accessed them.&quot; The aim of the proposal is to facilitate secure access and traceability to confidential financial records and messages focussing on the governance and assurance of access to records. A significance focus will be on removing the need to have a trusted authority in order to lower the costs associated with the operation of the system, which will allow for a strong business model for the deployment of the system.

Gateway for funding and Impact Validation using blockchain Ethereum (GIVE),"Ambiguity around how charities spend donations and the impact of their work is causing growing mistrust from public and institutional donors. Yet, impact measurement is complex and costly; precluding smaller charities and diverting resources from the primary work of large charities. If they could report impact and spending better, donors would give more. Blockchain technology could address these issues, so Alice has developed a MVP of a philanthropy platform called GIVE that helps charities to link donations to outcomes, and report on impact and spending much more easily and affordably than before. The result is greater transparency and trust in charities, which will increase donations; meaning more funds available to invest in the amazing work they do. For this project, Alice will collaborate with Imperial College to address and overcome the technical challenges that currently exist with blockchain, to increase transparency, trust and financial sustainability for valuable charities.",['Alice Si Ltd'],"['Imperial College London', 'Alice Si Ltd']",223535,Blockchain,EPSRC
Blockchain technology for Algorithmic Regulation And Compliance (BARAC),"BARAC investigates the feasibility of using blockchain technology for automating regulation and compliance producing a proof-of-concept platform and facilitating knowledge transfer by means of a bottom-up cross-disciplinary approach developed together with industry and regulators.

Blockchain Distributed Ledger Technologies (DLT) are of great interest to the financial industry because they have the potential to improve efficiency, augment security, eliminate duplications, simplify compliance and increase settlement speed, transparency and verifiability while preserving privacy and anonymity. These technologies are also of great interest to regulators because they provide very powerful auditing tools which can be used for automatic compliance reporting and algorithmic regulation. These technologies introduce several disruptive innovations in this area giving access to auditable data which are hard to tamper with and include both real time and the entire history; providing new instruments to monitor and quantify reputation of users; generating transparent, yet securely encrypted, environments where rules can be implemented enforced and adapted.

In this project we investigate technical, legal and managerial aspects related to use of DLT in the services industry including the significance of new business models and their effects on industry structure. BARAC aims to: i) demonstrate that blockchain technologies can be used to acquire and record financial activity data and to securely retrieve them for regulation and compliance purposes; ii) implement a case-study proof-of-concept platform for automatic compliance and algorithmic regulation from blockchain data; iii) transfer knowledge to industry and regulators and disseminate results to academic community and the wider public.

This will be achieved by adapting existing DLT systems, such as hyperledger (open source DLT project from Linux Foundation) and Corda (DLT project from R3-CEV for financial applications), to provide access to regulatory and compliance data for regulators and by designing smart contracts that automatically verify and execute regulations using smart contracts. We intend to set up a proof-of-concept platform where the feasibility of using DLT technology for compliance and regulation of financial services can be tested in practice addressing industry-relevant case studies. This platform will be built with a bottom up approach working together with our industry and regulator partners and constructed around their requirements and perspectives. 

BARAC addresses several challenges that span across many disciplines; therefore a cross-disciplinary effort is essential and indeed this project has gathered together PI and co-Co-Is from five different Departments including Computer Science, Mathematics, Law, Economics, Management and Finance from four different institutions. Together with academia, the proponents' consortium includes regulators, financial industry and the technology sector.

This project has the potential to radically change the way in which regulation and compliance are performed essentially reverting the present approach. Firms will no longer have the duty to report to regulators but instead regulators will access auditable data directly from the DLT. This will radically reduce the burden on firms increasing efficiency, transparency and eliminating the risk of unintentional breaching of compliance and regulation rules. The impact will not only be felt on the financial services sector but will also ripple across the entire services sector from healthcare to the food industry and education. Indeed all industries and services are regulated and need to comply by reporting information to the relative authorities and government bodies. It will also have impact upon business models and managerial practices.",['University College London'],"['R3 CEV', 'Financial Conduct Authority', 'Aesthetic Integration Ltd', 'British Telecommunications Plc', 'Morrison & Foerster', 'Advanced Technologies Solutions  s.p.a.', 'Cyprus Securities & Exchange Commission', 'Lykke']",616794,Blockchain,EPSRC

Settlement using blockchain to Automate Foreign Exchange in a Regulated environment (SAFER),"While forex is essential for businesses, SMEs are pushed out of the market due to the
financial crisis and resulting high compliance fees. Banks now consider SMEs too risky for
forex, limiting capacity for UK SMEs to trade outside the UK. SMEs with forex turnover of
less than &pound;1m are now being refused services, forcing most SMEs to use small (Tier 2) banks
who charge as much as 10% commission on each transaction.
Because forex systems in large banks require large teams of people, they are expensive to
operate, thereby often requiring min. &pound;50K per transaction and charging as much as 10%
commission on each transaction. These services are opaque about charges/costs and
inefficient (often taking 1 to 5 days) due to the number of intermediaries involved. Because
forex conversions are not simultaneous, participants are vulnerable to settlement risk

Taming Concurrency,"Computer programs are notoriously difficult to perfect (everyone has experienced some form of inconvenience from &quot;bugs&quot;) and even if this situation is beginning to come under control, it is at enormous cost. One reason for the high development cost of software is that errors made early in the design of a system can lay undetected until that system is tested - or even worse, used by customers. Correcting errors at such late stages is extremely expensive because so much work has to be repeated. So-called &quot;formal methods&quot; were first deployed on safety-critical software but are becoming more and more cost-effective because their use throughout design can drastically reduce the &quot;scrap and rework&quot; that comes from late detection of design mistakes. Formal methods make this possible because they use formal notations for specifying what should be built and thus offer a notion of correctness for each design step. Verifying design decisions becomes a proof process that can be helped by appropriate theorem proving software. Unfortunately, just as real progress is being made (both with general engineering practices and with the application of formal methods), separate commercial developments are increasing the challenges enormously. The general direction of new difficulties is &quot;concurrency&quot;. Programs that are concurrent have to run in contexts which interfere with their progress. Concurrency can come from a desire for better performance, from use of embedded programs in conjunction with physical devices such as cars and planes, or from the use of the latest hardware designs that are built from many processors. Traditional engineering approaches, and even many modern automatic tools for detecting errors in software, are not going to suffice for the world of massive concurrency because the number of execution paths is astronomically large when processes can interfere with each other. Fortunately, there is research (in which UK researchers are at the forefront) for reasoning both about where interference is absent and/or constrained. These research avenues, however, need to be brought together and tool support must be implemented before they are usable by engineers. These are the expected outputs of &quot;Taming Concurrency&quot;.",['Newcastle University'],[],643518,Crypto Currency,EPSRC

Verifiably correct concurrency abstractions,"Multi-core computing architectures have become ubiquitous over the last decade. This has been driven by the demand for continual performance improvements to cope with the ever-increasing sophistication of applications, combined with physical limitations on chip designs, whereby speed-up via higher clock speeds has become infeasible. The inherent parallelism that multi-core architectures entail offers great technical opportunities, however, exploiting these opportunities presents a number of technical challenges.

To ensure correctness, concurrent programs must be properly synchronised, but synchronisation invariably introduces sequential bottlenecks, causing performance to suffer. Fully exploiting the potential for concurrency requires optimisations to consider executions at low levels of abstraction, e.g., the underlying memory model, compiler optimisations, cache-coherency protocols etc. The complexity of such considerations means that checking correctness with a high degree of confidence is extremely difficult. Concurrency bugs have specifically been attributed to disasters such as a power blackout in north-eastern USA, Nasdaq's botched IPO of Facebook shares, and the near failure of NASA's Mars Pathfinder mission. Other safety-critical errors have manifested from using low-level optimisations, e.g., the double-checked locking bug and the Java Parker bug.

This project improves programmability of concurrent programs through the use of scalable atomicity abstractions such as TM and concurrent objects that make low-level optimisations available to general application programmers. Operations of such objects are highly concurrent (which improves efficiency), yet manage synchronisation on behalf of a programmer to provide an illusion of atomicity. Thus, by using TM, the focus of a programmer switches from what should be made atomic, as opposed to how atomicity should be guaranteed. This means concurrent systems can be developed in a layered manner (enabling a separation of concerns).

The attractive set of features that TM promises means that TM implementations are increasingly being incorporated into mainstream systems (hardware and software). Since the adaptation of transactions from database theory in the mid 1990s, software TM implementations are now available for all major programming languages. Recent advances include experimental features in compilers such as G++ 4.7 that directly enable compilation of transactional code; standardisation work to include TM within C++ is ongoing. There is extensive research interest in hybrid TM within both academia and industry to make best use of, for example, TM features in Intel's Haswell/Broadwell and IBM's Blue Gene/Q processors.

The high level of complexity, yet wide-scale applicability of TM means that implementations must be formally verified to ensure dependability and reliability. Overall, we will improve the dependability, performance, and flexibility of TM implementations.",['Brunel University'],[],14370,Crypto Currency,EPSRC

"Compositional, dependency-aware C++ concurrency","We address a difficult technical problem that is drawn from outside of the strict bounds of academic research: we seek a solution to fundamental problems found in the standards of the C and C++ programming languages. C and C++ code is not just prevalent -- it is used to form the lowest and most trusted levels of our systems. The kernel of every mainstream operating system uses some combination of the two, including Windows, MacOS, iOS, Android, Linux and Unix, as do the swathe of embedded controllers with essential functions like engine management. Having a good specification of the language is the first step in verifying the correctness of these vital system components.

-- Combatting software failure --

This work is part of a larger effort to combat software failure by developing techniques to verify the correctness of software. Currently, developers of computer systems rely predominantly on testing to ensure that systems behave as they should. The system is run for some time over various inputs and monitored for failure. The hope is that this will expose enough of the flaws in the system to have it behave reliably once it is deployed. But it is increasingly expensive to achieve good coverage: systems like cars experience varied inputs, and a fleet of a particular model runs collectively for far longer than the time its computer systems are tested. Worse still, modern systems are concurrent -- using multiple communicating processors to complete a task. The delicate interplay between the concurrent processors makes the output of the system dependent on the timing of communication, so that some behaviours occur only a handfull of times in billions of runs, leaving testing little hope of finding associated bugs.

There is evidence that this approach is breaking down and some bugs are evading discovery even in critical systems: for example a concurrency bug caused some of Toyota's cars to suddenly and relentlessly accelerate, killing 83 over 10 years. The wider economic cost of software failure was estimated by the U.S. National Institute of Standards and Technology to cost USD 60bn each year. Improving our approach to software failure would have substantial economic and societal impact.

Verification offers an alternative to testing: one defines desirable properties of the system -- it will not crash, fuel metering will be proportional to accelerator input, and so on -- and mathematically proves that the code satisfies them. In the ideal of verification, there is no space for bugs to creep in and the mathematical proof of correctness is absolute. Unfortunately, verification techniques are invariably built above an idealised model of the computer system, e.g. the assumption that memory accesses take place in a global sequential order, so called sequential consistency (SC). The distance between the ideal and the reality leaves ample space for bugs to persist. In fact the status quo is much worse because we do not have a characterisation of the reality of the system's behaviour: our best models of programming-language behaviour are known to be broken, e.g. in C, C++ and Java.

In this broad context, our project will develop a description of concurrency in the C and C++ languages that matches the reality, permitting the sorts of concurrent behaviour exhibited by compiler optimisations and the underlying concurrent processors. At the same time, we will support components written under the idealised SC assumption, enabling for the first time the use of the most powerful automatic verification techniques in a setting that correctly models the subtle concurrency behaviour of modern languages, dovetailing these previously disparate views of the system. Our work will make verification of concurrent systems more viable, helping to address the economic and social costs of software failure.",['University of Kent'],[],98786,Crypto Currency,EPSRC

Currency and Fiscal Policy Options for an independent Scotland,"<p>This Fellowship will examine Scotland's currency and fiscal policy options if Scottish voters choose independence. Upon gaining independence, Scotland would inherit a share of the existing UK public sector debt and will need to develop capital markets to fund this debt. this capital market will require a choice of currency. Scotland could use sterling, re-introduce its own currency or use another third party currency. However, each option will profoundly change the ability to raise capital and the conduct of fiscal and financial policy in Scotland.</p>

<p>The purpose of the Fellowship is to explore and explain the possibilities and possible consequences of each of these options. The core of the Fellowship is building the first large-scale global econometric model of an independent Scotland. This will be used to analyse various economic scenarios under alternative currency and fiscal arrangements. While there is some recognition of the importance of the interaction between currency, fiscal and financial policy, there is no discussion of the feasible policy options or the economic trade-offs they involve. Failure to ensure compatibility between these three dimensions will result in a vulnerable economic framework. </p>",['National Institute of Economic & Soc Res'],['University of Stirling'],260876,Crypto Currency,EPSRC
Leakage Aware Design Automation (LADA): Tools &amp; Techniques for Software Crypto Implementations,"Information leakage via side channels is a widely recognised threat to cyber security: in particular small devices are known to leak information via physical channels (power consumption, electromagnetic radiation, and timing behaviour). Side channel leakage provides skilled adversaries with information about otherwise secret internal variables, which can ultimately lead to complete security breaches in the form of secret key (or data) recovery. For small embedded devices, which feature architectures of limited complexity (i.e. a small number of pipeline stages, few data and/or address buses), the nature of the leakages can be appropriately modelled using statistical tools such as regression analysis or by estimating (multivariate) normal distributions. Our research hypothesis is that one can make meaningful statements about the leakage behaviour of new implementations on such devices by utilising a priori derived (instruction level) leakage models. 

Aiming to allow engineers with limited domain-specific knowledge to do just this, and hence improve the quality of software they develop, our overarching goal is: based on the development of a suitable instruction-level leakage model (for a device) plus specification of cryptographic primitives, we will explore techniques that allow sound assessment of leakage-related attacks on associated implementations without the need for a fully equipped side channel lab.",['University of Bristol'],['Embecosm Ltd.'],1150813,Crypto Currency,EPSRC
From Data Types to Session Types---A Basis for Concurrency and Distribution,"We aim to solve computing's most pressing problem - concurrency and distribution - by adapting one of computing's most successful concepts - the data type. Data types codify the structure of data; session types codify the structure of communication. Session types will enable a revolution in the development of concurrent and distributed software, making it cheaper to construct and maintain, and more reliable.

Concurrency and distribution are computing's most pressing problem: unless we discover a way to routinely and reliably build concurrent and distributed systems, a half century of unprecedented technical progress will draw to a close. We are approaching the 50th anniversary of Moore's Law, the observation that component counts and clock speeds double every 18 months. No exponential improvement can continue forever, and recently this rule has changed: clock speeds now remain fixed while the number of processors doubles, so exploitation of concurrency is essential. Meanwhile, everyone now has a computer in their pocket, and these computers depend crucially on communication to achieve their function. We inhabit a world of web applications, cloud services, and mobile apps: society increasingly depends on a technological infrastructure of concurrent and distributed systems.

Programming concurrent and distributed systems is notoriously difficult. Many solutions are based on shared memory, which requires the programmer to reason about every possible interleaving by which many processors access a common resource. Shared memory scales only to a certain point; it is not appropriate for programming the server farms that drive the web or for mobile applications. The most successful solutions so far appear to be those that replace shared memory with communication as the central structuring technique. Communication usually centres around the notion of a protocol, a series of operations in a specific order. However, direct support for protocols at the language level has been lacking, as compared with data types.

The data type is one of computing's most successful concepts. Data types appear from the oldest programming language to the newest, and cover concepts ranging from a single byte to organised tables containing information on customers and orders. Types act as the fundamental unit of compositionality: the first thing a programmer writes or reads about each method is its data type, and type discipline guarantees that each call of a method matches its definition. Data types play a central role in all aspects of software, from architectural design to interactive development environments to efficient compilation.

The analogue of the data type for concurrency and distribution is the session type. A session type codifies the notion of a protocol. Session types build on data types, as data types specify the lowest level of data exchange, upon which more complex protocols are built. Just as type discipline matches use and definition of a method, so session types ensure consistency between the two ends of a communication.

We expect session types to play a role in all aspects of software. Today, architects discuss the high-level structure of a system in terms of its types, but must resort to informal notions of protocol to describe communication; in future, they will describe communication in terms of session types. Today, programmers use tools that let them search for methods and modules based on their type, and give immediate feedback if their program violates type discipline, but must resort to informal notions of protocol when coding communications; in future, they will search for components based on their session type, and get immediate feedback if their program violates session type discipline. Today, software tools exploit types to optimise code, but cannot exploit the informal notions of protocol to optimise communication; in future, communication middleware will exploit session types to support efficient messaging.",['University of Edinburgh'],"['Amazon Co UK Ltd', 'Cognizant Technology Solutions', 'VMware Inc', 'University of California, San Diego', 'Red Hats Labs']",3956087,Crypto Currency,EPSRC
The Town Pound: A Network of Local High Street E-currencies,"Building on the marketing value of local currencies, as demonstrated by the launch of the Bristol Pound, we will, with Transition Town Totnes as a subcontracted partner, trial the concept of a national, 'local' e-currency – The Town Pound. Local currencies build local economic resilience by keeping more money circulating locally, helping to stimulate cross community connections and encouraging people to think about how they spend their money. 

We aim to create a locally branded currency on each high street that will act as a strong marketing and loyalty tool for local shops and services, making it easier for customers to fulfil their desire to buy local. We are also developing the ability to track individual units of currency to capture intelligence around how money is being used in a particular area. Crucially, this data could be used to identify new market opportunities. 

The Town Pound team will create a suite of products based on local currency concepts that offer additional benefits for high street traders: one stop online shop for each high street; click and collect service bringing people into high streets; collective loyalty schemes; business networking and brokering; granular retail management data. The currency will be in electronic form allowing consumers and traders to send and receive payments by the method most convenient to them, via mobile phone text message, Smartphone app, or online. Since consumer needs cannot be fulfilled entirely by local businesses, it will be possible to exchange the different currencies throughout the network of participating towns and cities across the country, making it the first and only UK National-Local Currency. 

We are proposing a complimentary currency that is designed to work alongside sterling, not replace it. Each town pound will be backed pound for pound by sterling deposits. Consumers will be able to use a local currency/online ordering/collection or delivery services from shops which may otherwise be unable to offer these services independently. We will also supply a business directory for users to find products and services, and a brokering service to actively encourage businesses to use each other. A loyalty programme to encourage repeat use of the scheme could be built in and there is scope to create special offers to encourage particular modes of purchasing.

In summary, our proposed solution will:
• Help identify flows of money and possible enterprise opportunities in the community.
• Offer a convenient way for customers to re-engage with their high street businesses and shop more locally.
• Capitalise on the pride that citizens may have in their locality.
• Offer added value to high street retailers. 
• Support the networked High Street, not just the shops but the supporting services as well.",['Bristol Pound Cic'],['Bristol Pound Cic'],100000,Crypto Currency,EPSRC
The Currency of Cultural Exchange: re-thinking models of indigenous development,"This research project proposes new ways to explore, articulate and stimulate cultural exchange between contemporary Brazilian indigenous peoples and non-indigenous societies as a means of more equitable economic and social development. The proposal has been devised in response to an initiative by the Kuikuro Indigenous Association of the Upper Xingu (AIKAX) to create a regular programme of residencies for non-indigenous artists and scholars within the Kuikuro village of Ipatse in the Upper Xingu region of Brazil. A network of Brazilian and British partners (academic and non-academic) will support a pilot programme enabling AIKAX to establish good practices, measure impact and demonstrate the ways in which culture exchange can stimulate economic development and welfare in ways that are not destructive to the culture and languages that have historically sustained a way of life intensely related to the land which they preserve and by which they are preserved. 

By establishing a controlled experiment in cross-cultural exchange that is initiated by one of the tribes of the Xingu, the research seeks to forge new connections between indigenous culture and the broader cultural industries in Brazil in the acknowledgement that this is an important feature of a development agenda. The collaboration will bring expertise on the economic and welfare impacts of arts and cultural activity to an indigenous initiative in order to extend understanding of how cultural interaction, creative innovation and collaborative cultural production can be conceived and measured as essential to the wellbeing of communities and individuals. 

The protagonism of the Kuikuro in the conservation, sharing, interpretation, representation, use and exchange of their own culture is the baseline for this research. AIKAX was formed in 2002 to preserve and present the Kuikuro cultural heritage and has been an active agent in determining the production and display of ethical representations which respect the rights of individuals as well as sustain their villages as cohesive communities. The research will seek to contribute to the development of professional practice by indigenous societies that engage in initiatives that propose cross-cultural exchange as a means of socially purposeful development. The AIKAX proposal seeks to make indigenous artists and thinkers protagonists in a new process of knowledge-exchange, fully aware that their experience and expertise have significant value within Brazil's own search for more effective ways to understand how culture contributes to social welfare. 

By creating a model that enables the Kuikuro to be agents in the process of exchange rather than passive consumers of external influences or victims of cultural invasions, the research seeks to discover and promote new learning that will strengthen capacity and define the terms on which indigenous peoples can become protagonists in the creative industries in Brazil (and beyond) in ways that resist the 'predatory nature of the productive system'. The research will recognize the legitimacy of historic cultural forms but also allow indigenous artists and artisans to develop autonomous practices in contemporary exchanges, maintaining and developing cultural production that prioritizes the preservation of the human and natural environment that maintains the lives of individuals and the welfare of the community.","['Queen Mary, University of London']",[],86852,Crypto Currency,EPSRC
Verifiably correct high-performance concurrency libraries for multi-core computing systems,"The benefits of fast computer systems are clear - improving performance allows more sophisticated applications to be developed. Speed-up via higher processor clock speeds, however, reached a physical upper limit in the early 2000s, with power-dissipation becoming a major issue. Hardware designers have therefore switched to multicore processors with fixed clock speeds, where speed-up is achieved by including several cores in a single processor. Multicore processors are now pervasive in all aspects of computing, from cluster servers and desktops to low-power mobile devices.

A multicore processor efficiently executes concurrent programs comprising multiple threads by allowing several computations to take place simultaneously in the different cores. These threads communicate via synchronised access and modification of shared resources stored in shared memory. While some problems (coined embarrassingly parallel problems) are naturally able to take advantage of multicore computing, the majority require clever management of thread synchronisation that is difficult to achieve. Moreover, modern architectures have forced programmers to understand intricate details of the hardware/software interface in addition to concurrency issues within the programs they develop.

Within a multicore processor, each processing core has access to a local buffer that acts as a temporary cache - any writes stored in a local buffer are not visible to other cores until the buffer is flushed. For efficiency reasons, multicore architectures implement so-called relaxed-memory models, where read and write events within a single thread may take effect in shared memory out-of-order, leading to behaviours that may not be expected by a programmer. Restoring correctness requires manual introduction of &quot;fence&quot; instructions in a program's code, which is a non-trivial task - under-fencing leads to incorrect behaviours, while overfencing leads to inefficient programs. Therefore, as Shavit states, &quot;The advent of multicore processors as the standard computing platform will force major changes in software design.&quot; There is a large international effort in both academia and industry to make better use of multicore processing, ranging from new foundational and theoretical underpinnings to the development of novel abstractions, tool support, engineering paradigms, etc.

In this project, we aim to simplify system development via practical solutions that are highly performant (to increase efficiency), verifiably correct (to ensure dependability) and cope with relaxed-memory models (as used by modern hardware). In particular, we develop efficient &quot;concurrent objects&quot; that provide abstractions from the low-level hardware interface and manage thread synchronisation on behalf of a programmer. Concurrent objects are to ultimately become part of a programming language library - some languages e.g., Java already offer basic concurrent objects as part of their standard library - hence are highly applicable.

The objects we deliver will take advantage of relaxed memory models. Here, it is well known that correctness conditions that are too strict (e.g., linearizability) are themselves becoming a barrier to efficiency. 
We therefore begin by developing new theoretical foundations in the form of relaxed correctness conditions that match relaxed memory models. A hierachy of different conditions will be developed, enabling one to easily determine the relative strengths of each condition. These conditions will be linked to a contextual notion of refinement to provide a basis for substitutability in client programs. This provides a basis for more efficient, verifiably correct, concurrent objects for relaxed memory models. We will focus on developing concurrent data structures (e.g., stacks, queues, deques) for the TSO memory model. Their verification will be mechanised in the KIV theorem prover to eliminate human error in verification, which in turn improves dependability.",['Brunel University'],"['Chalmers University of Technology', 'Victoria University of Wellington', 'University of Sheffield', 'University of Augsburg', 'University of Queensland', 'University of Paderborn']",98219,Crypto Currency,EPSRC
Smart Money: Precision Data Management for Distributed Ledger enabled Central Bank issued Digital Currencies,"This project investigates the data management, governance and social utility challenges concerned with how central banks, clearing banks and other stakeholders (Other Government Departments (OGDs), commercial financial institutions and citizens) can make effective use of Distributed Ledger (DL) enabled Central Bank issued Digital Currencies (CBiDCs). Central to this research is a governance framework which uses smart contracts to manage and police access rights to payment transaction data sets held on the DL for all certified and warranted stakeholders. Access to the content on the DL will be facilitated through a public key system, held by: individuals (allowing them to track or audit their own transactional activities); Government agencies (allowing them to explore gross levels of spending across different dimensions or categories, such as by citizen-spender segment or industry sector); and the Ministry of Justice (accessible only by smart judicial warrant for crime and security agencies or OGDs to access individual records). We will assess the feasibility of a how a fully auditable, tamper-proof, responsible smart governance system will make all stakeholders accountable for their data access and processing activities, whilst ensuring the protection of data and individual privacy. Moreover, access to rich payment transaction data will allow banks to perform economic forecasting and risk management in real-time and precision-targeting by patterns of spending. This has huge potential value in offering tools for economic stability and resilience, both at a national level, e.g. to assess aggregate exposure to bank debt, or at an institutional level (such as within a bank), e.g. to assess worrying levels of consumer debt by customer group. It could also be used to directly assess the economic impacts of government policy, for example by the Office of National Statistics in examining patterns of spending, and GCHQ in mining patterns of financial traffic for national security. Who to involve, how they would want this data made available for access, what the economic value and cost of running DL enabled CBiDC services is, and how citizens and civil society groups find it to be socially acceptable are therefore all research questions that we will investigate. This will be conducted through research activities exploring how the financial architecture and models, information content and structure, and information presentation will impact on the value, use, interpretation, and application in forecasting of the financial and economic content available from the DL. Alongside, we will offer (i) insights and recommendations into the design of current and novel digital ledger infrastructures that are grounded in worked examples of use, (ii) evaluate their likely potential impact and relevancies and identify to whom these issues should be of concern to, and (iii) work alongside central bankers and end-users as stakeholders to ensure that design solutions meet their needs.",['Brunel University'],"['The Bank of England', 'Office for National Statistics']",606068,Crypto Currency,EPSRC
